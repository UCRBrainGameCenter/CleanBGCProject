# BGC_Tools Demo Project

A simple Unity project demonstrating some of the features of BGC_Tools

## Features

Built on the ruined remains of a stripped-down version of an internal project, this project demonstrates use of `BGC.Users.PlayerData`, `BGC.StateMachine`, some `BGC.Audio` features, and a few of the `BGC.IO` mechanics.  Also integrates the `FileBrowser`.

Take a look at the [BGC_Tools Repository](https://github.com/UCRBrainGameCenter/BGC_Tools) for a closer look at the plugin this project is demonstrating.

This project also serves to demonstrate some of the Unity programming idioms we've adopted at the Brain Game Center.

We've attached the MIT License to the project, and encourage people to poke around at what we've created and see if any of it might be useful to you.

Pull Requests are welcome.

## How To Use

This was built in Unity 2018.3.5f1.

Just clone this repository and initialize submodules:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UCRBrainGameCenter/CleanBGCProject
cd CleanBGCProject
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Then open the project in Unity.

### NOTE

Run the SplashScreen scene at least once in order to properly initialize and expand some of the project files.
