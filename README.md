# BGC_Tools Demo Project

A simple project demonstrating some of the features of BGC_Tools

## Features

Built on the ruined remains of a stripped-down version of an internal project, this project demonstrates use of `BGC.Users.PlayerData`, `BGC.StateMachine`, some `BGC.Audio` features, and a few of the `BGC.IO` mechanics.

This project also serves to demonstrate some of the Unity programming idioms we've adopted at the Brain Game Center.

We've attached the MIT License to the project, and encourage people to poke around at what we've created and see if any of it might be useful to you.

Pull Requests are welcome.
